A JAR file has been created to make things easier. The source code for the
different classes and programs are provided under the src folder. Here is
directions on how to run the programs.

IMPORTANT:

	You must be in the directory of the JAR file (same as readme.txt file)
	for the program to run with these exact commands. If you are not, then
	ensure correct file paths.

	Each component of the assignment runs by passing the program # as an
	argument to the JAR file i.e. java -jar A1.jar Q<program #> <args>

PROGRAM 1:

	java -jar A1.jar Q1

	From here, the program will prompt you to enter a list of words space
	separated, and will count the occurrences of each word.

PROGRAM 2:

	java -jar A1.jar Q2

	From here, the program will prompt you for a number of lines, and then
	have you enter that many lines. It will then reverse and print out each
	line in reverse order.

PROGRAM 3:

	java -jar A1.jar Q3

	From here, the program will prompt you to choose a Polygon, and then ask
	you for the inputs of the specified polygon. It will output the area and
	perimeter of the shape you choose.

PROGRAM 4:

	java -jar A1.jar Q4 <input path>

	Example: java -jar A1.jar Q4 input.txt

	From here, the program will evaluate each mathematical expression, and
	ouput the results.

	(you can use any file containing mathematical expressions line by
	line to run this program. Just pass it as an argument in replacement
	of input.txt.)

PROGRAM 5:

	java -jar A1.jar Q5 <input path>

	Example: java -jar A1.jar Q5 input2.txt

	From here, the program will determine how many boxes can be used.

DISCLAIMER:

	I realize that this is publicly available. If you are in CMSC256 at VCU and
	have this same assignment, do NOT copy this and pass it off as your own. You
	will get caught, and I won't be held accountable for any cheating. This is
	here to document the programs/projects I do both at home, work, and for my
	classes at the university.
